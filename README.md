Privacy Policy

To use this application, you will be required to provide your location information. To support the calculation of audio prompts, the application collects location data even when the application window is closed and the screen is turned off. "(Your device may be in your pocket instead of in your hands).

This application is provided free of charge and is intended to be used “as is”. This page is used to inform visitors about my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. If you choose to use this application, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information I collect is only used to calculate audio prompts. I will not use or share your information with anyone.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in our Terms and Conditions which are available on AyAylite, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
